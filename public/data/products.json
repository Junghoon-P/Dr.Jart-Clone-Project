    "description": "This soft cheese made from goat's milk is a marriage of chèvre and brie that's an approachable variation for soft-cheese lovers. Produced in the beautiful countryside of the Périgord region of France, the Pico Affiné boasts aromatics of fresh hay with a slightly tangy taste and earthy flavor. We think it pairs best with a glass of fruit-forward sparkling white wine.",
